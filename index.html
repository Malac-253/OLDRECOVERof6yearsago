</div>
<div class="leftb">
<h2>Don`t go to the Mayan civilization</h2>
<h3>Just look at their customs</h3>
<p>The Mayan customs were a huge part of the Mayan culture because they were very set on their beliefs. When a member of one's family died they were buried in simple graves just under their houses. The wealthy people were buried in tombs accompanied with some of their belongings such as their jewelry, pottery, or food. In the Mayan culture it was common for there to be ancestor worship especially to the royal, thought to rejoin the Gods when they died. Another common custom was human sacrifices to the Gods. One way of doing this was by ripping out their hearts and leaving them there for offering to the Gods, or by throwing them down a cliff. They used humans as their sacrifices because it was believed that the Gods needed human blood to grow stronger. Yet another custom that was practiced sometimes was self-torture; on more dedicated levels one would practice self-torture daily. Sometimes, on very big festivals for religious reasons they would have dances when they dressed up with masks to look like Gods. Some of the dances were done to insure the success of crops though. These are just a few of the Mayan customs out of the hundreds of small and big customs that they practiced while they were still living.</p>

    <h1 style="color:gold">Why not</h1>
    <p>Why go anywhere else but Egypt. Who wants to look at the beauty of paper at mesopotania? Who wants to be indulged at the beauty of a sewer system at Harrapan? Who really wants to be involved in a blood sport at Mayan? so make the right decision , go to Egypt and see the majestic pyramids.</p>
    <h2 style="color:red">This is why ...</h2>
    <h3 style="color:blue">Egypt geography</h3>
    <p>The ancient Egyptians had natural barriers. There were deserts to the east and west of the Nile River, and mountains to the south. This isolated the ancient Egyptians and allowed them to develop a culture. The Nile is the world's longest river. It is over 4000 miles long! Each spring, water would run off the mountains and the Nile would flood. As the flood waters receded, black rich fertile soil was left behind. The ancient Egyptian called this rich soil The Gift of the Nile. Fertile soil for crops was not the Nile's only gift. The Nile gave the ancient Egyptians many gifts. Thanks to the Nile, these ancient people had water for drinking and bathing. Because of the annual flooding of the Nile, the ancient Egyptians enjoyed a high standard of living compared to other ancient civilizations. Without the Nile, Egypt would be a desert.</p>
    <h3 style="color:blue">Egypt writing</h3>
    <P>Egyptian hieroglyphs were a formal writing system used by the ancient Egyptians that combined logographic and alphabetic elements. Egyptians used hieroglyphs for religious literature on stone and paper like wood.  Visually hieroglyphs are sometimes stylized and simplified, but all generally perfectly recognizable in form. However, the same sign can, according to context, be interpreted in diverse ways. Most hieroglyphic signs are phonetic in nature, meaning the sign is read independent of its visual characteristics .Phonograms formed with one consonant are called unilateral  sign; with two consonants, bilateral    signs; with three trilateral signs. Later, Scribes needed a faster way to write things down. They created a new form of writing called Demotic script. </P>
    <h3 style="color:blue">Egypt science and techology</h3>
    <p>The Ancient Egyptian calendar is a little different from ours today. There were ten days in a week, three weeks in a month, four months in a season, three seasons in a year, and five holy days. That adds up to a 365-day year. The Egyptians were the first people to come up with the 365-day year. Egyptians clocks were much different from ours as well. There were two types of clocks in Ancient Egypta water clock and a sundial. A water clock sounds very complicated, but really its not. It is a little stand with a pot on the top of the stand and a pot at the bottom of the stand. The pot at the top of the stand had a hole drilled in the side. This pot was then filled with water and the water would flow out of the top pot down to the bottom pot. When the water was at a certain level, it was a certain time. The only disadvantage to the water clock was that you had to keep refilling it. The sundial was basically a circle with numbers written around it with a little stick in the middle. When the sticks shadow fell at a certain number, it was that time. One big advantage the water clock had over the sundial was you couldnt use the sundial at night and the water clock you could.</p>
    <h3 style="color:blue">Egypt everyday life</h3>
    <p>In the Egyptian family the father was responsible for providing for his family. The mother stayed home and raised the children. Small children and other female relatives lived in a special part of the house. Much of the children's time was spent in training for their adulthood. The Egyptians wore very simple clothing. The clothes were made of linen. Linen was made from the flax that grew in the fields. It was woven into cloth. The rich wore finely woven linen while the workers wore a more durable material. Children wore no clothing until they were in their teens.  Egyptians wore sandals made from leather or reed. One common likeness on Egyptian jewelry was the scarab or beetle. Egyptians believed the scarab to be the symbol of resurrection or life after death. Both men and women wore earrings and bracelets on their upper and lower arms. Some children between the ages of 4 and 14 went to school the learn to read, write, and do arithmetic. When a boy turned 14 he began working in his father's profession. The girls stayed at home with their mothers to learn how to run a house. Egyptians ate two large meals each day: one at dawn and another at dusk. They ate plenty of cereal, vegetables, and fruits. Some of the most common foods were barley, wheat, lentils, cucumbers, beans, leeks, onions, dates, figs, and grapes. Food was cooked in clay ovens. Peasant boys married by the age of 15. Girls were only 12 when they married. Girls from more wealthy families married a little older. Many marriages were arranged by parents. The life expectancy of an Egyptian was only around age 40. Egyptian homes were made from bricks. Bricks were made of sun dried mud. Mud bricks lasted a long time in the hot country which had little rainfall. Wealthy families built single level homes surrounded by gardens full of trees and flowers. They even had small lakes or ponds in their gardens. </p>

    <h3 style="color:green">Egypt`s challenges</h3>
    <h4>Disease in ancient Egypt</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Eye diseases cause from the sand and dust of Saharan climate.</li>
        <li>Illness caused by bites of scorpions or serpents.</li>
        <li>Diseases affecting internal organs</li>
        <li>Tuberculosis: several instances of spinal tuberculosis have been reported from human remains from Egypt.</li>
        <li>Polio : evidence for the occurrence of polio(poliomyelitis) in Egypt</li>
        <li>Parasitic diseases: guinea-worm, roundworm, tapeworm </li>
    </ul>
    
   
    <h2 style="color:gold">But overall</h2>
    <h2 style="color:gold">You should go to see...</h2>
    <h1 style="background-color:gold"> The Pyramids</h1>
		<p>The most famous Pyramid at Giza is the Cheops Pyramid. It is 449 feet tall and the sides are 755 feet long. The Giza Pyramids cover an area larger than ten football fields and are made up of over 2,000,000 limestone blocks. The average weight of a single block is about 2 1/2 tons. That is like two medium size cars. However, some blocks weigh up to 15 tons! The Giza Pyramids were built during the reign of King Khufu. It took over 400,000 people and almost 30 years to build these pyramids. They were completed in 2580 BC. The Pyramids at Giza were named after three kings: Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure.When the pyramids were built, the Egyptians did not have many machines. They only had simple tools. Egyptians built the pyramids without slaves. They used farmers instead. They helped for two reasons: One, their fields would be flooded because of the annual flood of the Nile River. Two, they were paid. Not in money but in food and clothing. When the Pyramids were completed the Egyptians put mummies of pharaohs inside of them. They also filled the pyramids with food, hunting supplies, and treasure for the Afterlife. </p>

		 <h4>How to Build a Pyramid</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Level out the sand where the pyramid is going to be built. Do this so that the base of the pyramid will be even. This will make the base more stable.</li>
        <li>Make stone blocks from the Nile River. Do this by gathering clay from the Nile River and shape it with a trowel so that the sides of the blocks will have a flat surface.</li>
        <li>Bake the shaped blocks in the sun. Do this by placing a block in the sun and letting it sit until the clay hardens</li>
        <li>Put the blocks together to form a square base. Do this by taking the blocks and putting them side by side to make one of the pyramids layers look like a square. To hold the blocks together, put mud between them and let it dry. Drill holes into the blocks and put pegs into them to hold the blocks together.</li>
        <li>Build a triangular structure. Do this by making the structure a triangular shape with four sides leading to the top of it.</li>
